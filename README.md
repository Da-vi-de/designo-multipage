## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

It's a static website but a really challenging one, because of its particular layout that changes depending
on device. The aim of this project was practicing component composition, i tried naming folders and files in the most
clear way possible. Happy about how the real map shows the locations, it was exciting even though the docs were a bit
unclear on how to proceed! I love styled components especially when dealing with some logic is necessary, eg: hamburger menus.
I experimented a differnt approach with the form which i learned a while ago, the button is disabled till completion, i added a green check and some info for name and email inputs! The entire app is fully accessible, i checked each page with lighthouse, mobile and desktop.
